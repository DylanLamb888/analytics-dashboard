Build an Order Analytics Dashboard (Python + Visualization)

Summary
We’re looking for an experienced and skilled developer to build a web-based analytics dashboard that transforms our order data feed
into meaningful insights. You’ll create tools to filter by date, extract location data, track top-selling items, generate heatmaps and time series, and support item-level analytics. Clean UI and accurate data handling are a must.

Key Responsibilities:

Ingest & normalize data

Extract and parse addresses (city/state/ZIP)

Visualize trends (eg top items, sales by region/time)

Build filters (last 30/90 days, custom)

Export reports and data

Skills Required:

Python (Pandas, Regex, Flask or FastAPI)

Data visualization (Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit)

Geospatial parsing (ZIP, city, state from address)

Frontend basics (React, HTML/CSS optional)

Attention to detail is a must, plus points for being on the specturm!

Shortlisted candidates will get a sample CSV and spec doc.
